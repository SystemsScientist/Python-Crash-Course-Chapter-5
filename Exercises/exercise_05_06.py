# Stages of Life: Write an if-elif-else chain that 
# determines a person's stage of life. Set a value
# for the variable age, and then:

age = 18

#   - If the person is less than 2 years old, print 
#     a message that the person is a baby

if age < 2:
    print("You are a baby.")

#   - If the person is at least 2 years old but less
#     than 4, print a message that the person is a 
#     toddler

if age >= 2 and age < 4:
    print("You are a toddler.")

#   - If the person is at least 4 years old but less
#     than 13, print a message that the person is a
#     kid

if age >= 4 and age < 13:
    print("You are a kid.")

#   - If the person is at least 13 years old but less
#     than 20, print a message that the person is a
#     teenager

if age >= 13 and age < 20:
    print("You are a teenager.")

#   - If the person is at least 20 years old but less
#     than 65, print a message that the person is an
#     adult

if age >= 20 and age < 65:
    print("You are an adult.")

#   - If the person is age 65 or older, print a message
#     that the person is an elder

if age >= 65:
    print("You are an elder.")
