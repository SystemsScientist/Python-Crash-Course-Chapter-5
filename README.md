# Python Crash Course - Chapter 5 Exercises and Solutions

This repository contains the Examples, Exercises, and Solutions 
for Chapter 5 of Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes, which 
covers if statements, conditional tests.

I created this repository for two reasons. First, I wanted to 
incorporate Git and GitHub with Python and Vim into my workflow,
so I could give myself an opportunity to practice the technologies.
Second, I wanted to show my work. That is, I used Python and Vim on
a Fedora 37 system in a VirtualBox environment to create, use, and
manage directories and files as I work through Matthes' Python Crash
Course book.

Please feel free to reach out to me at matthewjohnson@snarkydata.com
if you have any questions or comments. In addition, feel free to 
utilize the exercises and solutions for your consumption and 
edification.

Technical Notes and Considerations
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile and execute the Chapter 5 files,

    (1) copy the code and past it directly into your preferred
        integrated Development Environment (IDE), PyCharm, Sublime,
        or Visual Studio, for example, or your preferred text editor,
        Vim, Nano, or Emacs, for example,
    (2) and either build and run the files in your IDE
    (3) or use the following command-line script:

            $ python3 name_of_file.py
